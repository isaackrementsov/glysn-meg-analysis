241,2.0,95,easy_money.mrg,I was confused enough I let the G word slip
242,2.0,96,easy_money.mrg,Was this crazy treasure hunt
243,3.0,43,lw1.mrg,Right now he looked like an overgrown wolf learned touch typing
244,3.0,44,lw1.mrg,The scout ship from the hole a brilliant speck emerging from a sphere of velvety blackness

246,3.0,46,lw1.mrg,Launch the second probe
247,3.0,47,lw1.mrg,Central be crushed to learn that another gateway has yielded little more than a class F planet and a white dwarf system
248,3.0,48,lw1.mrg,Level and and
249,3.0,50,lw1.mrg,let loose a small growl as if caution his charges against false hope
250,3.0,51,lw1.mrg,twenty seven gates so far and none had turned up anything worth time
251,3.0,53,lw1.mrg,Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that would spell end for project and species
252,3.0,67,The_Black_Willow.mrg,How perfectly awful
253,3.0,67,cable_spool_fort.mrg,No time outs Tucker shouted and continued to climb down the tires
254,3.0,68,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Several more boys out after him
255,3.0,69,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Arthur at the vivid description
256,3.0,69,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Roy Chad called but his voice would only whisper
257,3.0,70,The_Black_Willow.mrg,sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption
258,3.0,70,cable_spool_fort.mrg,He want to be a crybaby Tucker hated
259,3.0,71,cable_spool_fort.mrg,The rules of the game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his flag
260,3.0,72,The_Black_Willow.mrg,I know Allan replied but how am I to
261,3.0,72,cable_spool_fort.mrg,From painful experience he knew it was too slow or too weak do anything
262,3.0,73,The_Black_Willow.mrg,make my stories thus but it is my nemesis confronting me anew at every turn
263,3.0,73,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Tucker liked hit and liked see blood
264,3.0,74,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Arthur raised a critical brow
265,3.0,74,cable_spool_fort.mrg,down too would only make him mad so Chad reached behind him grab the five stickers had managed collect before the start of the game and readied himself
266,3.0,75,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Perhaps could make some headway if denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors so enjoy
267,3.0,75,cable_spool_fort.mrg,The boys came in quick from all sides knocking Chad down but managed roll his feet and get one sticker off into a arm before being knocked down again
268,3.0,76,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Every action take to deny it nourishment will bring closer to your goal and believe me Allan must take every opportunity to this uncivilized obsession if intend to publish
269,3.0,76,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Baby
270,3.0,77,The_Black_Willow.mrg,There simply is no audience for fairy tales no literate audience at least
271,3.0,77,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Tucker was standing over him with the huge held high in the sun
272,3.0,78,The_Black_Willow.mrg,It is true Allan admitted fidgeting with his would dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher
273,3.0,78,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Penis
274,3.0,79,The_Black_Willow.mrg,even tried rewriting the corrupted sections but once my characters road nothing can recall their former life
275,3.0,79,cable_spool_fort.mrg,You fight
276,3.0,80,The_Black_Willow.mrg,My prodigal ink blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road
277,3.0,80,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Chad tried tell his arms lift him and let him reach for the prove a baby Tucker
278,3.0,81,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Arthur and his wine
279,3.0,81,cable_spool_fort.mrg,But much wanted appease the scary staring angry boy move for fear of what was coming next
280,3.0,82,cable_spool_fort.mrg,make you fight
281,3.0,83,The_Black_Willow.mrg,If only would restrain this morbid impulse of yours might write something really worth reading
282,3.0,83,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour it blew in face
283,3.0,84,The_Black_Willow.mrg,It appear in the refined world of print like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd
284,3.0,84,cable_spool_fort.mrg,na take the plug out
285,3.0,85,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan hung his head holding his wine with both hands between his knees
286,3.0,85,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Then face became serious
287,3.0,86,The_Black_Willow.mrg,His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night and his clothing had a look as if by mere proximity it had taken on the aspect of his
288,3.0,86,cable_spool_fort.mrg,The of what intended pulling his eyes wider still
289,3.0,87,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He scratched the back of his dark head and blinked bleary eyes
290,3.0,87,cable_spool_fort.mrg,From his pocket pulled a small screwdriver perfect for prying plugs from heads
291,3.0,88,The_Black_Willow.mrg,would drive it out he said softly but fear for what would remain
292,3.0,88,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Now legs and arms and mouth worked and was up and running and screaming Roy go inside
293,3.0,97,easy_money.mrg,Or maybe this guy was just a wacko who wanted to take me out on a dark road and kill me
294,3.0,98,easy_money.mrg,No more complicated than that but I need to show you the mound for you to understand
295,3.0,99,easy_money.mrg,The drawings and the books seemed to wake him up
296,3.0,100,easy_money.mrg,He was smiling now and his eyes so tired
297,3.0,102,easy_money.mrg,I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make so I said yes but my patience was running out
298,3.0,103,easy_money.mrg,It was dark as we left
299,3.0,104,easy_money.mrg,The drive was shorter than I expected
300,3.0,105,easy_money.mrg,We pulled up to a little asphalt parking spot in front of a historical marker
301,3.0,106,easy_money.mrg,When he killed the headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on a light dusting of snow
302,3.0,107,easy_money.mrg,A low black hill blocked the sky right in front of us
303,3.0,108,easy_money.mrg,up here he announced stepping over the cable fence and starting up the hill
304,3.0,109,easy_money.mrg,We spent the next hour stomping around the hill while he said things like it was right here
305,3.0,110,easy_money.mrg,My patience was long gone and I was back in the car to warming up when Acres tapped on the window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for
306,3.0,111,easy_money.mrg,We back up the hill and he led me to little patch of ground with a stick poking up from it
307,3.0,112,easy_money.mrg,It looked like a bamboo walking stick
308,3.0,113,easy_money.mrg,This is it he leaned down and for me to look at something on the ground
309,3.0,114,easy_money.mrg,I casually slid a knife into my palm just in case
310,3.0,115,easy_money.mrg,See how the lines form the pattern in the journal the same one as the
311,3.0,116,easy_money.mrg,So you drew this I asked vaguely slow to catch on
312,3.0,117,easy_money.mrg,He looked hurt and rapped on the ground with his finger
313,3.0,118,easy_money.mrg,stone
314,3.0,119,easy_money.mrg,Ancient
315,3.0,121,easy_money.mrg,He stood up using the stick to help
316,3.0,122,easy_money.mrg,For the first time he looked cold and stiff in his tourist gear making me glad I was in a suit
317,3.0,123,easy_money.mrg,Here stand beside me he said
318,3.0,124,easy_money.mrg,I I I
319,3.0,126,easy_money.mrg,expected him pull out a gadget blinking lights and was wondering which way duck
320,3.0,127,easy_money.mrg,Trick gesture
321,3.0,128,easy_money.mrg,like sleight of hand
322,4.0,89,The_Black_Willow.mrg,you require a rest from writing suggested Arthur
323,4.0,90,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Roy
324,4.0,91,The_Black_Willow.mrg,You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat improve your disposition
325,4.0,91,cable_spool_fort.mrg,He sprinted for the corner of the building around which Roy had disappeared
326,4.0,92,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Perhaps it would Allan replied rising and straightening his suit
327,4.0,92,cable_spool_fort.mrg,The door was on that side and Rayburn
328,4.0,93,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Just then a horrible pain stung Chad cheek and neck and ear
329,4.0,94,The_Black_Willow.mrg,I shall consider it in the meantime however I must be off
330,4.0,94,cable_spool_fort.mrg,The yellow branches scratched around him as it dug into his face
331,4.0,95,The_Black_Willow.mrg,You have been a gracious host as always
332,4.0,95,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Tucker made a grab for him but missed it and Chad heard his shirt rip a little
333,4.0,96,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Arthur rose and shook his hand
334,4.0,97,The_Black_Willow.mrg,So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home he said
335,4.0,97,cable_spool_fort.mrg,He ran like only a small boy can run but he was losing and he wished hard that he could fly
336,4.0,98,The_Black_Willow.mrg,I hope soon to see you in better sorts
337,4.0,98,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Roy
338,4.0,99,The_Black_Willow.mrg,They parted and Allan made his way from gate
339,4.0,99,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Chad rounded the corner grabbing the cinder block to help him turn faster just as Tucker came down again with the from behind and the world slowed almost to a stop
340,4.0,100,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He walked the wheel ruts hands in his pockets and shoes collecting dust
341,4.0,100,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Roy stood with the bill of his cap down
342,4.0,101,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Some quarter mile from gate he halted confronted by
343,4.0,101,cable_spool_fort.mrg,His head rose and his eyes focused over shoulder
344,4.0,102,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Nathan he called out to the empty road
345,4.0,102,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Roy held stickers in his hand like flowers but he bent looking down and snatched something from the ground
346,4.0,103,The_Black_Willow.mrg,The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree
347,4.0,103,cable_spool_fort.mrg,His hand blurred and snapped out as he stood back up
348,4.0,104,The_Black_Willow.mrg,I had a hunch you
349,4.0,104,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Something as it spun past Chad
350,4.0,105,The_Black_Willow.mrg,lanky frame dressed in a loose tan jacket fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton
351,4.0,105,cable_spool_fort.mrg,turned to look
352,4.0,106,The_Black_Willow.mrg,His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface his body with a energy
353,4.0,107,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside how goes life the quintessential American author
354,4.0,107,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Tucker there with surprised expression crossed eyes the in one hand the screwdriver held up high in the other ready to stab down into back
355,4.0,108,The_Black_Willow.mrg,know replied Allan before continuing in another tone entirely
356,4.0,108,cable_spool_fort.mrg,flat flint rock split forehead was buried deep solid like part of Halloween costume complete with drop of blood starting down toward his nose
357,4.0,109,The_Black_Willow.mrg,destroyed another story last night
358,4.0,109,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Tucker dropped down like jacket from hook
359,4.0,110,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Leaning against his tree shook his head
360,4.0,110,cable_spool_fort.mrg,lay folded over his own lap in way that made Chad think of broken things
361,4.0,129,easy_money.mrg,He his fingers and then blew on them
362,4.0,130,easy_money.mrg,OK watch and remember this
363,4.0,131,easy_money.mrg,going to do it in two parts last part first so it take effect
364,4.0,132,easy_money.mrg,Remember to reverse the two parts when you actually do it
365,4.0,133,easy_money.mrg,Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did a sort of sign language stutter of some sort
366,4.0,134,easy_money.mrg,I learned this from a skull they are
367,4.0,135,easy_money.mrg,just a memory device
368,4.0,136,easy_money.mrg,I which seemed to please him
369,4.0,137,easy_money.mrg,Yes
370,4.0,139,easy_money.mrg,They help in remembering steps in a ritual or ceremonial gestures
371,4.0,140,easy_money.mrg,a long history of Polynesian gesture and dance
372,4.0,141,easy_money.mrg,Now you do it
373,4.0,142,easy_money.mrg,He smiled and I could see his teeth in the moonlight
374,4.0,143,easy_money.mrg,I wanted to slug him but he had the keys to the car back and I figured I I
375,4.0,144,easy_money.mrg,I I had
376,4.0,145,easy_money.mrg,I
377,4.0,146,easy_money.mrg,I
378,4.0,147,easy_money.mrg,standing on a perfectly flat square of dark stone
379,4.0,149,easy_money.mrg,For far I could see by a weak gray light stone stepped up and down making little hills and and platforms
380,4.0,150,easy_money.mrg,I seemed be somewhere in middle there above below
381,4.0,152,easy_money.mrg,sky dull and and overcast
382,4.0,153,easy_money.mrg,air smelled bad in way I describe and feet I could see same design from little journal and mound carved into rock
383,4.0,154,easy_money.mrg,I in shock
384,4.0,155,easy_money.mrg,blood pounded in head and I stood there blinking and listening a sort of ringing whine in ears
385,4.0,156,easy_money.mrg,next moment Acres there
386,4.0,157,easy_money.mrg,Hands up in same way mine were frozen
387,4.0,158,easy_money.mrg,We looked each other
388,4.0,159,easy_money.mrg,I guess thinking back I might expected gloat view kind of thing that humbles you shuts your mouth
389,5.0,111,cable_spool_fort.mrg,You ok
390,5.0,112,The_Black_Willow.mrg,You mean finished another story
391,5.0,112,cable_spool_fort.mrg,It was Roy and when Chad looked up there was something like his brother there around the eyes
392,5.0,113,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Yes it is finished
393,5.0,113,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Yeah
394,5.0,114,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Ended
395,5.0,114,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Chad stepped back away from open eyed face
396,5.0,115,cable_spool_fort.mrg,He was na take off your head plug
397,5.0,116,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Never again shall it see the rosy fingered dawn
398,5.0,116,cable_spool_fort.mrg,I thought he might stab you Roy said and his neck forward to look at Tucker
399,5.0,117,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Nathan you
400,5.0,118,The_Black_Willow.mrg,know just as well as I that they have no future no potential
401,5.0,118,cable_spool_fort.mrg,blinked and sob
402,5.0,119,The_Black_Willow.mrg,At best they tales at worst expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see
403,5.0,119,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Nah
404,5.0,120,The_Black_Willow.mrg,So instead you would write what
405,5.0,120,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Chad said na be in trouble
406,5.0,121,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Something something worth reading worth writing
407,5.0,121,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Yeah Roy said
408,5.0,123,The_Black_Willow.mrg,I want to write as others do a tale set in our real world characters who might live therein not citizens some airy beyond the stars
409,5.0,123,cable_spool_fort.mrg,he shrugged
410,5.0,124,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Why is that more desirable than what you write today
411,5.0,124,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Suddenly his blank seemed like of Play Force Soldier or Joe
412,5.0,125,The_Black_Willow.mrg,People will such stories they are worth publishing
413,5.0,125,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Hey Roy
414,5.0,126,The_Black_Willow.mrg,If you never finish such stories how can they be worth publishing
415,5.0,126,cable_spool_fort.mrg,What
416,5.0,127,The_Black_Willow.mrg,That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct
417,5.0,127,cable_spool_fort.mrg,suck
418,5.0,128,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Why do you write
419,5.0,128,cable_spool_fort.mrg,Chad finished formula but this time he mind that Roy fell for it
420,5.0,129,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Why to earn a living I suppose
421,5.0,129,cable_spool_fort.mrg,It was all right
422,5.0,130,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Why do you ask
423,5.0,131,The_Black_Willow.mrg,You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter though you face such difficulty
424,5.0,132,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Why is that
425,5.0,161,easy_money.mrg,We just stood looking at each other for a little while I know how long
426,5.0,162,easy_money.mrg,What is it was all I could think to say
427,5.0,163,easy_money.mrg,Acres just shrugged
428,5.0,164,easy_money.mrg,A place
429,5.0,165,easy_money.mrg,I know
430,5.0,166,easy_money.mrg,I think this whole thing he waved his hand at the horizon is one big machine
431,5.0,167,easy_money.mrg,And the markers were carved later not be whoever built it
432,5.0,168,easy_money.mrg,The markers are places where safe to come here and leave
433,5.0,170,easy_money.mrg,Safe
434,5.0,171,easy_money.mrg,I looked around
435,5.0,172,easy_money.mrg,One thing this place seem was safe
436,5.0,174,easy_money.mrg,Let me show you the rest
437,5.0,175,easy_money.mrg,He started walking down the steps and around a corner
438,5.0,176,easy_money.mrg,It would have taken plenty to surprise me after what I had already seen but My jaw was banging against my shoelaces when I rounded that corner
439,5.0,177,easy_money.mrg,not sure how something so big could have been hidden by that little turn in landscape but maybe perspective work quite the same there
440,5.0,178,easy_money.mrg,Glaring down at me from no more than twenty feet away was a thirty foot tall black face with staring blue and white eyes and it wore a ridiculous little hat
441,5.0,179,easy_money.mrg,For some reason I thought of a giant clown face from a carnival ride but it scared the hell out me
442,5.0,180,easy_money.mrg,Acres stood beside it and somehow using him as a yardstick for the scale of the thing made it easier to see
443,5.0,181,easy_money.mrg,It was a
444,5.0,182,easy_money.mrg,He had a serious sincere look on his face and he was pointing to the ground
445,5.0,183,easy_money.mrg,This is what I wanted to show you
446,5.0,184,easy_money.mrg,I looked down and saw he was pointing to another marker just slightly different from the one we had just left
447,5.0,185,easy_money.mrg,I was pretty rattled but things fell together for me looking at the big statue the Hawaiian shirt and the mark on the ground
448,5.0,186,easy_money.mrg,Easter Island
449,5.0,187,easy_money.mrg,Acres nodded
450,5.0,188,easy_money.mrg,It was all too much for me so I focused on the part I could handle
451,5.0,189,easy_money.mrg,So what does this have to do with gold
452,5.0,190,easy_money.mrg,You could step on that marker and make the gestures the device and it would be like pushing a button in a very complex machine
453,5.0,191,easy_money.mrg,You would end up on a small hill on
454,5.0,192,easy_money.mrg,You could step three feet to the right and do the same thing and you would end up buried alive in a nearby rock face
455,6.0,133,The_Black_Willow.mrg,I suppose it is because I enjoy my craft
456,6.0,134,The_Black_Willow.mrg,I would not be happy thus separated from it
457,6.0,135,The_Black_Willow.mrg,So at its heart then your writing as opposed to working otherwise is for yourself
458,6.0,137,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Yes I suppose one could see it thus
459,6.0,138,The_Black_Willow.mrg,But really Nathan your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level
460,6.0,139,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Ignoring the statement Nathan continued
461,6.0,140,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Your writing is for you Allan not for the publishers or some imagined audience
462,6.0,142,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Since you seem unable to write normally why not embrace your tales as they are leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure
463,6.0,143,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Your stories strike a chord with the deepest most ancient stories of mankind the tales basic to humanity
464,6.0,144,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Tell them and they will create an audience
465,6.0,145,The_Black_Willow.mrg,You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are speak and they shall listen
466,6.0,146,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan crouched over his desk once more pen in hand and mind blank
467,6.0,147,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He contemplated a story an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago
468,6.0,149,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He had filled his pen and raised it the descending towards the paper before the sound came the gentle persistent tapping the the
469,6.0,150,The_Black_Willow.mrg,the the
470,6.0,151,The_Black_Willow.mrg,the the
471,6.0,152,The_Black_Willow.mrg,the
472,6.0,153,The_Black_Willow.mrg,the the the the
473,6.0,154,The_Black_Willow.mrg,the eye
474,6.0,193,easy_money.mrg,I know how to make it take me anywhere

502,7.0,157,The_Black_Willow.mrg,What in name could have possessed you to do such a thing cried Arthur nearly raising his voice
503,7.0,158,The_Black_Willow.mrg,After all I said the day before why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self indulgent fantasy
504,7.0,159,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He shook the papers at Allan raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son
505,7.0,160,The_Black_Willow.mrg,This is nothing but a glorified tale a child of a creation less fit to be published than to be told around open fire at the hovel of some peasant

548,8.0,179,The_Black_Willow.mrg,You know what this is like said Allan shaking his head
549,8.0,180,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Nathan would understand completely
550,8.0,181,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Even as he said it Allan prayed that his statement was true
551,8.0,182,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Very well said Arthur then take your story to that and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you
552,8.0,183,The_Black_Willow.mrg,If you insist on abandoning me I shall not hold you
553,8.0,184,The_Black_Willow.mrg,With that he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room
554,8.0,186,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Stunned Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order
555,8.0,187,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken making his way past his doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan
556,8.0,188,The_Black_Willow.mrg,read the package of words in silence his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages
557,8.0,189,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan sat across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period
558,8.0,190,The_Black_Willow.mrg,At long last Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them
559,8.0,191,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan leaned forward unconsciously
560,8.0,193,The_Black_Willow.mrg,the best story ever written
561,8.0,194,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts
562,8.0,195,The_Black_Willow.mrg,So he asked you think a waste of ink and paper a futile expedition into or literary debauchery
563,8.0,196,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Heavens no said Nathan aghast
564,8.0,197,The_Black_Willow.mrg,This is one of the strongest works read in ages
565,8.0,198,The_Black_Willow.mrg,It speaks to the deepest instinct within us all yet is entirely original
566,9.0,199,The_Black_Willow.mrg,My dear friend you have done it
567,9.0,200,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Oh they may rail against you at first they may you as a heathen or a literary savage but while those in power say such things others will read your tales and see their true worth
568,9.0,201,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now
569,9.0,202,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan though dubious as to that possibility felt some temptation from the compliment mainly it granted him the encouragement he still needed
570,9.0,204,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face
571,9.0,205,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right although the man was somewhat peculiar he had both an honesty and a certain propensity for insight
572,9.0,206,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Certainly it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them
573,9.0,207,The_Black_Willow.mrg,His strangest fruit had last and he found the taste less bitter than expected
574,9.0,208,The_Black_Willow.mrg,These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home
575,9.0,210,The_Black_Willow.mrg,It was evening and the sky burned orange in the west when he home at last
576,9.0,212,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Passionate fiery colors filled the western sky before him though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead
577,9.0,213,The_Black_Willow.mrg,As Allan drew closer he distinguished a new cloud a pillar rising directly ahead a road of smoke ascended in the west its source hidden by the very that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door
578,9.0,214,The_Black_Willow.mrg,thoughts fled as one scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning
579,9.0,215,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He ran the last distance crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below walking to the carriage parked before house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in and loaded it onto the roof
580,9.0,216,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Arthur paused in the door looking up at Allan for a moment then he turned and shut the door behind him
581,9.0,217,The_Black_Willow.mrg,The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on
582,9.0,218,The_Black_Willow.mrg,As they forth eyes remained trapped by the carriage following it up the and past himself
583,9.0,220,The_Black_Willow.mrg,The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows
584,10.0,221,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He watched as the carriage drew still more distant the horses hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway
585,10.0,222,The_Black_Willow.mrg,When they had gone he remained stunned until the scent of recalled him to himself
586,10.0,223,The_Black_Willow.mrg,He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done
587,10.0,224,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Rounding the corner he saw a great bonfire
588,10.0,225,The_Black_Willow.mrg,A mass of flaming wood stood before him heat him and sparks flying too close to his house
589,10.0,226,The_Black_Willow.mrg,It was a moment before he realized what else had changed near the wall beneath his window was a stump with black and ancient bark
590,10.0,228,The_Black_Willow.mrg,In a thoughtless panic Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the
591,10.0,229,The_Black_Willow.mrg,His thoughts were not of the futility nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing instead all that filled his mind was the constant presence in his life growing with him and beside him its persistent reminders that he had higher truer things to write the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake
592,10.0,230,The_Black_Willow.mrg,His handfuls could do nothing to the the the the
593,10.0,232,The_Black_Willow.mrg,the tree considered also motivation whether some good might come this after all
594,10.0,234,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Leaving the circle stood turned towards the woods in which it was his habit walk in a mood
595,10.0,235,The_Black_Willow.mrg,stepped slowly beneath the branches a gust wind stirring up the behind in a great swirling eddy a brand that rose up dispersed on the winds as though it were the last breath
596,10.0,236,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks fog strangely beautiful impossible penetrate
597,10.0,237,The_Black_Willow.mrg,considered intervention considered that it might be better accept the fog continue as his lifelong friend had suggested write stories that others would read for after all what purpose writing if be read
598,10.0,238,The_Black_Willow.mrg,without that torturous willow might be free write whatever saw fit
599,10.0,239,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Indeed if still could could at any time follow advice seek a profession more grounded in reality
600,10.0,240,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind
601,10.0,241,The_Black_Willow.mrg,found along the bank a low wide stream allowed follow its current
602,11.0,243,The_Black_Willow.mrg,As it turned to the deeper woods elder giants rose above him a beech smooth bark a gray green pennant on a slope and standing out between the dark cracked trunks of the nearer trees great pines a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three stroke symbol of the British King a towering black birch leaves impossibly high above him
603,11.0,244,The_Black_Willow.mrg,As the stream wound its way through the largest pines grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as Allan continued slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the giants
604,11.0,246,The_Black_Willow.mrg,There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal
605,11.0,247,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Emerging from between the trunks Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped
606,11.0,248,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Before him roots the sweet water of the stream grew a stand of black
607,11.0,249,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Fallen trunks lay rotting across the the living elders the grove while younger trees still small and not yet as knotted and as their forefathers sprang up where branches reached the ground
608,11.0,250,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Though the elders trunks fell and died their children first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead continued a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors
609,11.0,252,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Allan stumbled forward jaw slightly slack until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted three willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself
610,11.0,253,The_Black_Willow.mrg,Collapsing at its base Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream flowing through the ground beneath them
